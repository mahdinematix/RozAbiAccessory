Welcome to my first serious project in backend development. What i learned? I'm opinion that a most important things that i learned is onion architecture because a project without architecture hasn't readability and maintainability.
Other technologies and things I learned include: .Net Core, MVC, Razor Page, Onion Architecture, SQL Server, EFCore, LINQ, SOLID, OOP, Clean coding, Ajax, SEO
