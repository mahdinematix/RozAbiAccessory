Welcome to my first serious project in backend development. What i learned? I'm opinion that a most important things that i learned is onion architecture because a project without architecture hasn't readability and maintainability.
Other technologies and things I learned include: .Net Core, MVC, Razor Page, Onion Architecture, SQL Server, EFCore, LINQ, Unit testing, xUnit, TDD, Refactoring, Design Patterns, SOLID, OOP, Clean coding, HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Ajax, React, SEO, Git
